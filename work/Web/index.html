            <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Andre Clark. I am 21 years old, and I have lived in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho since 2008. Before That, I grew up In Marseille, France. I went to public school there and still speak French to this day. Albeit, my French may be a bit rusty. Marseille is the second largest city in France by population so the move to Coeur d’Alene was a culture shock. There was a stark difference of the climate and culture from what I was familiar with. Namely, Coeur d’Alene is not a sprawling port metropolis by the Mediterranean that virtually never experiences snow.

                I have always been passionate about computers and technology in general. From what feels like the beginning I knew I wanted to do something relating to computers. I went to an Information Technology technical program in High school and College. I learned a great deal about computers and began building gaming PCs as a hobby. However, I have decided to go in a new direction and choose to pursue Web design instead. Having dabbled in web design while in high school, I am excited to pursue web design as a career.

                Recently, I've become interested in a new emerging technology, virtual reality. Namely head mounted displays. Recently, I have purchased A Virtual Reality headset. Unlike a two dimensional screen, in virtual reality you get a distinctive sense of presence and depth. Watching friends experience it for the first time is exciting. It is truly a unique experience that cannot be truly explained without experiencing yourself. I highly recommend trying it in person.
